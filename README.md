# Description

Most of the projects you will go through above are a "Data Analyst" oriented projects. I have tried to apply my knowledge of python and SQL to different side projects which 
I did along with my studies. 

I am also interested in Data Engineering and Machine Learning which I consider very important for two different reasons. As of now researching and analyzing data is what I 
am passionate about and is something which I can do tirelessly with great enthusiam.

The projects consists of data cleaning , modelling and EDA. The visualizations for these projects are in a different repo as I wanted to organize everything for clarity.

Feel free to go through my work.
